              Why the heck might you want to do this? Well it actually makes for writing generic functions which you can tailor to specific cases very easy.

              You could write a function which works on tables from Data Workspace schemas. With this approach of currying or partially applying the function you can
              create a function which is extremely generic and shareable but also then reduce the overhead of having to pass so many arguments by specialising it
              to your schema. This will help you to reduce the visual density of such programs and make it easier to maintain, develop and debug.

            <p>
              Tail recursion is when a function calls itself as the very last thing it
              does, allowing the computer to replace the current function call with a
              new one instead of stacking up memory.

# Tail-recursive factorial function
factorial_tail <- function(n, acc = 1) {

    # Use tail_call for proper tail recursion optimization

    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[Any]:
        # In-order traversal

            yield from self.left

              Let's break this down in detail.

              This defines a binary tree data structure using Python's dataclass. Each node has:

              - A value of any type
              - An optional left child (another Tree or None)
              - An optional right child (another Tree or None)

              The __iter__ method implements an in-order traversal.
              This method does something quite clever.

              - If there's a left child, it first recursively yields all values from the left subtree
              - Then it yields the current node's value
              - If there's a right child, it recursively yields all values from the right subtree

              This creates an in-order traversal of the binary tree, which means:

              - Left subtree is processed first
              - Then the current node
              - Then the right subtree
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <pre><code class="python">
    def __next__(self) -> Any:
        # This makes the tree itself an iterator
        raise NotImplementedError("Use __iter__ for iteration")

# Create a sample tree
tree = Tree(
    value=5,
    left=Tree(3, Tree(1), Tree(4)),
    right=Tree(7, Tree(6), Tree(8))
)

# Iterate through the tree
for value in tree:
    print(value)  # Prints: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
            </code></pre>

            <aside class="notes">
              This prints the values in sorted order because it's a binary search tree where:

              - Left subtree values are less than the current node
              - Right subtree values are greater than the current node

              Use cases for this structure include:

              - Implementing binary search trees
              - Efficient sorted data storage
              - Creating custom iterators
              - Tree-based algorithms (traversal, searching, etc.)

              Key benefits:

              - Allows treating the tree like a standard Python iterator
              - Provides a clean, recursive way to traverse tree structures
              - Supports lazy evaluation (values are generated on-the-fly)

class Optional:

            <aside class="notes">
              Okay that last one was a bit of a complicated example. Let's go with something simpler.

              The Optional type allows you to map over it by its very definition. This let's you
              evaluate functions against the internal type of the Optional and not have to worry about
              extracting them out of it. Of course with the typing in python and R being dynamic your
              function will need to be able to handle whatever it might come across but this simplifies use
              against an object that could be one of multiple different types.

            <aside class="notes">
              These are super useful. If your input data is presented as a generator stream, then you
              don't necessarily want to evaluate all of your stream to get the values and then apply
              a function to them. This lets you create a new generator with your function applied!

            These examples demonstrate how different data structures can implement functor-like
            behavior through mapping operations that transform contained values while preserving
            their original structure.

            <aside class="notes">
              In Python, functors aren't as fundamental as in purely functional languages
              like Haskell, but they're still a powerful concept. While Python doesn't have
              built-in functor protocols like some languages, we can create generic functor-like
              operations using protocols, abstract base classes, or duck typing.

              Included in the repo is an example of such an implementation.

                - immutability: with this, you can be certain that the original input remains unchanged, making a function's behavior more predictable and easier to understand.
                - concurrency: immutable data eliminates many concurrency issues because data can't be unexpectedly modified by different threads.
                - purity: pure functions with immutable data always produce the same output for the same input, making them:
                  + Easier to test
                  + Easier to debug
                  + More predictable
                  + Amenable to memoization and optimization
                - efficiency: this is implemented compiler side in modern functional programming languages
                - errors: you can eliminate whole classes of bug types by having immutable data

              - first-class functions: yeah, they both have this, that's great
              - pattern matching: introduced in python 3.10, see my snippets for an example!
              - algebraic data types: they're so important and you don't get to have them.

              Why ADTs?
              Algebraic data types (ADTs) are important in programming because they provide
              a structured and expressive way to model data and encapsulate logic.

              1. Rich and Expressive Modeling
                  ADTs allow you to define data structures that closely align with the domain you're working in. For example, you can represent a Shape as a sum type with constructors like Circle, Rectangle, or Triangle, capturing all possible variants in a clear and concise way.
                  This expressiveness helps ensure that invalid states are unrepresentable.


              2. Type Safety
                  By defining data using ADTs, the compiler can enforce constraints, preventing many kinds of runtime errors. For example, pattern matching on an ADT ensures that all possible cases are considered (when exhaustiveness is enforced), reducing the likelihood of unhandled cases.


              3. Pattern Matching
                  ADTs pair naturally with pattern matching, enabling clean and declarative handling of different cases. This makes the code easier to read, maintain, and debug compared to verbose conditional logic.


              4. Composition
                  ADTs are composable. You can create complex types by combining simpler ones using sum types (e.g., Either, Maybe) and product types (e.g., tuples or records).
                  This modularity simplifies complex systems by breaking them into manageable pieces.


              5. Expressing Intent
                  ADTs communicate the programmer's intent more clearly than traditional imperative code. For example, a Result type (Success | Failure) explicitly signals that a function may succeed or fail, making the API more self-documenting.


              6. Robust Refactoring
                  Since ADTs are tied to the type system, changes to their structure are easier to propagate across the codebase. The compiler helps identify all places affected by the change, reducing the risk of introducing errors during refactoring.


              7. Immutability
                 Many functional languages enforce immutability for ADTs, making them ideal for concurrent and parallel programming. Immutable data reduces side effects and makes reasoning about code easier.

              8. Foundation for Functional Programming
                  ADTs are foundational to functional programming. They enable functional patterns like map, flatMap, and folds to operate seamlessly, facilitating the use of higher-order functions and monads.


              9. Data Validation and Default Safety
                  Using ADTs such as Maybe or Either helps model optional or fallible computations explicitly, avoiding the pitfalls of null or unchecked exceptions common in other paradigms.

            - Haskell is the best. Haskell Book is the go to.
            - Clojure is a Lisp dialect, and there's a very good book called Clojure for the Brave and Bold.
            - Scala is what Twitter/X is written in. No idea where best to learn it though.
            - Elixir has a very good data science base and can be learnt through Joy of Elixir pretty well.
            - F#. Microsoft doing functional programming.
            - Rust. Okay, this one has a caveat (hence the asterisk). Its not a functional programming language, but
              does include the following features.
              + Immutability by default
              + First-class and higher-order functions
              + Powerful pattern matching
              + Algebraic data types (enums)
              + Option and Result types (similar to Maybe/Either in functional languages)
              + Iterator methods that support functional transformations
              + Closure support
              + Generics and traits that enable functional abstractions

            You'll be relieved to hear that this is the end.

            But what was the point? I'm only here to evangelise the functional programming paradigm. I promise you that
            if you go and put the time into thinking in this way and implementing programs using this approach then
            your code will be better. Hands down, in every way. It will help you to think more about representing the
            problem and your solution to it far better than doing it imperatively or in a stateful way. It will make
            you a better programmer for it.
