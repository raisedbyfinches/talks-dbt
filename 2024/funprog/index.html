              <p>Why the heck might you want to do this? Well it actually makes for writing generic functions which you can tailor to specific cases very easy.</p>

              <p>You could write a function which works on tables from Data Workspace schemas. With this approach of currying or partially applying the function you can
              create a function which is extremely generic and shareable but also then reduce the overhead of having to pass so many arguments by specialising it
              to your schema. This will help you to reduce the visual density of such programs and make it easier to maintain, develop and debug.</p>

              Tail recursion is when a function calls itself as the very last thing it
              does, allowing the computer to replace the current function call with a
              new one instead of stacking up memory.

              <p>Let's break this down in detail.</p>

              <p>This defines a binary tree data structure using Python's dataclass. This is just a class
                 that is tailored to storing data/attributes instead of methods</p>
              <p>Each node has:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>A value of any type</li>
                <li>An optional left child (another Tree or None)</li>
                <li>An optional right child (another Tree or None)</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The __iter__ method implements an in-order traversal.</p>
              <p>This method does something quite clever.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>If there's a left child, it first recursively yields all values from the left subtree</li>
                <li>Then it yields the current node's value</li>
                <li>If there's a right child, it recursively yields all values from the right subtree</li>
              </ul>

              <p>This creates an in-order traversal of the binary tree, which means:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Left subtree is processed first</li>
                <li>Then the current node</li>

                <li>Right subtree values are greater than the current node</li>

            These examples demonstrate how different data structures can implement functor-like

              In Python, functors aren't as fundamental as in purely functional languages
              like Haskell, but they're still a powerful concept. While Python doesn't have
              built-in functor protocols like some languages, we can create generic functor-like
              operations using protocols, abstract base classes, or duck typing.

              Included in the repo is an example of such an implementation.

              <p>Time to talk about the elephant in the room.</p>

              <p>Python and R are not functional programming languages. Over time they are 
              incorporting more and more features from functional programming but they are
              multi-paradigm languages.</p>

              <p>I cannot talk about some key tenets of functional programming languages using
              R and python as the vehicles in which to do so. There are some key ideas that
              are not there.</p>

              <p>However, understanding concepts from functional programming will make you a better
              programmer.</p>

                <li>algebraic data types: they're so important. Its a little disingenuous to say "NO" but this is about "out of the box" behaviour.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Why ADTs?</p>
              <p>Algebraic data types (ADTs) are important in programming because they provide
              a structured and expressive way to model data and encapsulate logic.</p>

              <p>
              1. Rich and Expressive Modeling
                  ADTs allow you to define data structures that closely align with the domain you're working in. For example, you can represent a Shape as a sum type with constructors like Circle, Rectangle, or Triangle, capturing all possible variants in a clear and concise way.
                  This expressiveness helps ensure that invalid states are unrepresentable.
              </p>
              <p>
              2. Type Safety
                  By defining data using ADTs, the compiler can enforce constraints, preventing many kinds of runtime errors. For example, pattern matching on an ADT ensures that all possible cases are considered (when exhaustiveness is enforced), reducing the likelihood of unhandled cases.
              </p>
              <p>
              3. Pattern Matching
                  ADTs pair naturally with pattern matching, enabling clean and declarative handling of different cases. This makes the code easier to read, maintain, and debug compared to verbose conditional logic.
              </p>
              <p>
              4. Composition
                  ADTs are composable. You can create complex types by combining simpler ones using sum types (e.g., Either, Maybe) and product types (e.g., tuples or records).
                  This modularity simplifies complex systems by breaking them into manageable pieces.
              </p>
              <p>
              5. Expressing Intent
                  ADTs communicate the programmer's intent more clearly than traditional imperative code. For example, a Result type (Success | Failure) explicitly signals that a function may succeed or fail, making the API more self-documenting.
              </p>
              <p>
              6. Robust Refactoring
                  Since ADTs are tied to the type system, changes to their structure are easier to propagate across the codebase. The compiler helps identify all places affected by the change, reducing the risk of introducing errors during refactoring.  
              </p>
              <p>
              7. Immutability
                 Many functional languages enforce immutability for ADTs, making them ideal for concurrent and parallel programming. Immutable data reduces side effects and makes reasoning about code easier.
              </p>
              <p>
              8. Foundation for Functional Programming
                  ADTs are foundational to functional programming. They enable functional patterns like map, flatMap, and folds to operate seamlessly, facilitating the use of higher-order functions and monads.
              </p>
              <p>
              9. Data Validation and Default Safety
                  Using ADTs such as Maybe or Either helps model optional or fallible computations explicitly, avoiding the pitfalls of null or unchecked exceptions common in other paradigms.
